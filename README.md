# Kaggle-Titanic

The repository works as a review of a startup project on Kaggle —— to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on his or her information.

It is made up of three parts: 
* Exploratory analysis of the data, visualization of some distribution of features and the relationship between target value and predictors.
* Feature extraction and engineering. The mosy tricky part of the Titanic case!! You need to combine current features and define new ones. The more detailed information you can tap from the features, the more accurate your model will be.
* Modeling. Use gridsearch to find optimal parameters for classifiers. Bagging is also tried.

Four results were submitted. The second one is of the best performance and rank top 33% of the leaderboard currently.

Further improvement will still be on feature engineering......as mentioned, the most tricky one...
